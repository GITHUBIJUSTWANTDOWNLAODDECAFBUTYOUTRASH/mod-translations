Russian translation for Redstone clock mod

Tested on 1.16.5, unsure about 1.18.2

Open your mod as archive in 7-zip and put translation (ru_ru.json) into assets/redstone_clock/lang/

Be damned, you, russophobe creature. American Empire will fall down!

Everytime when you DOWNLOAD my translation, you fight Neoliberalism, Globalism and warcrimes of NATO and Ukrainian army.

Do not try block Russian translation file in mods, anyway i will just modificate English translation to Russian. Good luck.
