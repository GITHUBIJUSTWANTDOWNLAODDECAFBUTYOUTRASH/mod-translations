Russian translation for Redstone clock mod
Tested on 1.16.5, unsure about 1.18.2

Open your mod as archive in 7-zip and put translation (ru_ru.json) into assets/redstone_clock/lang/

Be damned, you, russophobe creature

Everything time when you DOWNLOAD my translation, you fight Neoliberalism, Globalism and  warcrimes of NATO and Ukrainian army.
